# JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Here are some key points about JavaScript:

- **Client-Side Scripting**: JavaScript is commonly used for client-side scripting, enabling interactive web pages that respond to user actions.
- **Server-Side Development**: With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to various events such as user clicks, form submissions, and page loads.
- **Object-Oriented**: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing for the creation of reusable and modular code.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, making it possible to perform tasks like fetching data from a server without blocking the main thread.

## Example

Here is a simple example of JavaScript code that changes the content of an HTML element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="myHeader">Hello, World!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeText()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "You clicked the button!";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the text of the header element changes.
